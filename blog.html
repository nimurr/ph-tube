            <h2>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const ?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Answer of Ver :</span> Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible within the function they are declared in, regardless of where they appear within that function.</li>

                <li><span>Answer of Let :</span> Unlike var, let is not hoisted to the top of its block. This behavior prevents certain types of bugs and makes the code more predictable.</li>

                <li><span>Answer of Const :</span> Note that this immutability applies to the binding itself, not necessarily the value it holds. For example, if a const variable holds an object, you can modify properties of the object, but you cannot assign a new object to the variable.</li>

            <h2>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined ?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Answer of Null Vs Undefined :</span> In many cases, null and undefined can be used interchangeably to represent absence of value, but it's a good practice to use them intentionally and consistently based on their semantics. If you're not sure which one to use, consider the context and whether the absence of a value is due to lack of initialization (undefined) or intentional omission (null).</li>

            <h2>What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Answer of Rest Api :</span> RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services due to their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the existing infrastructure of the World Wide Web. They are commonly used to expose data and functionalities over the internet, enabling different applications to communicate and interact with each other seamlessly.</li>
